                <h3>From my teaching career</h3>
                <p>I had "a calling" to teach, and started at age 17 in my free time as a volunteer teaching children with special needs. For the next ten years teaching was the major focus of my career. Although I love to teach, you rarely get to develop awesome software, which I love more, and so I decided to move on. However, the experience left me with an enormous respect for teachers everywhere. Education is at the heart of the type of future we are building for humanity.</p>
